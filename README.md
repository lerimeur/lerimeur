I am currently studying at EPITECH, on the promotion for 2023.
On the past two years at EPITECH, I use Github as main workflow.

I also use it on my personal projects.

I am currently learning new languages like Flutter and Typescript.

Actually, alongside the school I work as a Freelance developer in Web development.
